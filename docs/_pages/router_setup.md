The router is responsible for setting up the local network used by all components of the robot to talk to each other.

## Unpacking the router

The router we are using in this project is a TP Link mini router TL-WR810N. When unpacking it, the box should contain:

- the router 
- one micro-usb cable (used for powering the router)
- one ethernet cable (we will use it later to connect the [raspberry pi](/ILR/rpi_setup/) to the router)
