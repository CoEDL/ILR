The router is responsible for setting up the local network used by all components of the robot to talk to each other.

## Unpacking the router

The router we are using in this project is a TP Link mini router TL-WR810N. When unpacking it, the box should contain:

-the router 
-one micro-usb cable (used to power the router)
-one ethernet cable (we will use it later to connect the [raspberry pi](/rpi_setup/) to the router)
