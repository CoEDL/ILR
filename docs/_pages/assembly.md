You will need:

- All *The Woods* found in NgOpie carrying case
- The pins and wedges included in your *polymer bag*
- Four of the M3x16mm screws included in your *polymer bag*
- Four wing nuts included in your *polymer bag*

Follow these steps

1. Assemble the feet and rear feet brace first
1. Place the torso board taking care that the torso panel faces the right way (*rightway = countersunk holes face the user*) 
1. Find the rear braces *notice that the side with the semicircular pattern clips onto the torso*
1. Fasten the torso and the rear braces together using the m3x16mm screws and the wing nuts
1. Find the rear diagonal braces and the wooden pins. the diagonal braces will connect the feet and the rear braces 
1. Fasten them using the wooden pins and wedges as shown in the video
1. find the head and proceed to follow the same instructions as per steps 2 and 4

You will need:

- Lenovo tab 10 tablet
- Tablet holder
- Four of the M3x25mm screws included in your *polymer bag*
- M2 hex key included in your *polymer bag*

Follow these steps

1. Use two of the M3 screws and loosely fasten the bottom screws
1. Place the tablet inside the holder taking care that the rear camera sits at the top and unobstructed  (*this is only to make sure that the orientation is correct, in fact the camera is not used in any of the robot apps*)
