The speaker ensures that the sound can be loud enough for use in public spaces (e.g. classroom). The speaker we use for the project is a *Sony SRS-XB10*, and should be paired with the [Tummy tablet](/ILR/tummy_setup) by following the steps described below.

## Unpacking the speaker

The tablet used for the head is a *Sony SRS-XB10* speaker. When unpacking it, the box should also contain a micro-usb cable that we will use to power it.

## Pairing the speaker with the tablet : speaker side
 
- Turn on the speaker by pressing the <i class="fas fa-power-off"></i> button

- Press and hold the <i class="fas fa-power-off"></i> button to prepare the speaker for pairing. The speaker should make a "beep" sound, and the LED indicator should start blinking

## Pairing the speaker with the tablet : tablet side

- On the tummy tablet settings menu, select the *Bluetooth* arrow, and the "More Settings" menu.

- You should see the SRS-XB10 appear in the list of devices to pair with. Click on its name to pair.

- After a few seconds, you should hear a "beep" sound from the speaker, indicating that the two devices have been paired properly. The mention "connected" should also appear on the tablet interface.

- Click on the <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> icon next to the name of the speaker to access more options. Make sure that "Pad audio" and "Media audio" are both ticked. You can also change the speaker name from here.

**Note**: This step is optional, but will help identify the robot speaker better. We recommend setting the name of the speaker to *SRS-XB10_name_of_the_robot*

The tablet and the speaker are now paired. Try playing a sound in the tablet (for instance by starting the tummy app if you have done the [setup step](/ILR/tummy_setup) already)
