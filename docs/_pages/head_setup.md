The head tablet is responsible for the social components of interaction, by displaying the eyes of the robot. 

## Unpacking the tablet

The tablet used for the head is a LENOVO 7" tablet. When unpacking it, the box should also contain a micro-usb cable that we will use to power the tablet

### Setting up an account for the robot

The apps for the head and tummy tablet will be downloaded from the Google Play Store. When setting up these tablets, you will need to link them to a gmail account used for Google Play Store. 

Create an email address for the robot, and make sure you keep records of the address and password. 

**Warning**: The head and tummy apps are currently available only as a closed released. This means the address you use to download them must be registered before you can doanload the app. If you have created a new address at this stage, contact the ILR team and ask them to add the mail address to the list of testers.

When you start the tablet for the first time, you will be asked to link it to a gmail account (cf. screenshot). Enter the robot email address (this can be modified later if you make a mistake or change the address).

The first initialization of the tablet will likely include selecting the tablet language and optionally registering for the LENOVO ID program. 

## Downloading the app

**Warning**: At this stage, your tablet should be connected to a network with internet access
